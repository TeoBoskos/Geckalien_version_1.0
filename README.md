# 2D Game Made Using Python and Pygame

This is a very small 2D game that I made during the summer break of 2024. It doesn't have anything special,
because the whole goal was to help me implement what I have learned from a Python course that I bought.

# What Does It Have

Not much really. The player can move around somewhat smoothly, jump and double jump ( even triple jump ).
He can interact with the ground and some platforms, both of which are made by a kind of grass block that
I made in photoshop.

Every time the player gets on a platform, his score is incremented by 1. Every time his score is exactly
divisible by 10, a sound effect plays.
If the player falls from a cetrain height and up, he takes some damage. Currently, when the player's health
reaches 0, the game terminates ( if you have any other idea let me know ).

# What I want help on

If you are kind enough and have the skills and the free time to do it, I would be grateful if you made me a
better player model, because I tried making one in photoshop...it did not end well.

# Found Any Bugs?

If you happen to stumble upon any bugs in my game, please know that I am open to any kind of criticism that is
going to help me improve my skills. Thank you.
