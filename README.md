So this is my first ever game using Pygame. I worked for it for around two months if we exclude holidays.
Everything in the game except of the background image was made by me. Of course I searched for some help on the internet now an then. Anyway, I hope you enjoy it,
despite it being SUPER simple. Thank you.

I am planning to work on it in the future multiple times, slowly improving it.
